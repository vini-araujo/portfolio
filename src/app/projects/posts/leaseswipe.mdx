LeaseSwipe is a Full-Stack Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL app. It was created by a group of 6 people using GitHub for version control.

A problem a lot of people encounter when looking for subleasers is the fear of them not getting along with your roomates.
To solve that issue, LeaseSwipe allows you to look through the pool of people looking for a house, and you can look at their profile
and see their interests, lifestyle, and contact information to get to know them better before comitting on signing the contract.
